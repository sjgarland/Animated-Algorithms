        Early applications of computing were concerned mainly with numeric computation:
        evaluating mathematical functions, solving equations, or performing scientific
        and statistical calculations.  Subsequently applications became increasingly
        concerned with processing text and not just numbers.  Even so, many
        applications&mdash;not just in science and engineering&mdash;still manipulate 
        numbers.  Hence it pays to have a variety of tools for performing standard numeric
        computations.  Some of these tools can solve problems that are difficult or 
        impossible to solve by mathematical analysis alone; others can solve
        problems that ordinarily require more sophisticated mathematical
        techniques than non-experts may possess.
        </p><p>
        It would be wrong to conclude that computing is a replacement for
        mathematics.  Rather, computing complements mathematics: it helps put mathematics 
        into practice, and mathematics helps in performing computation.
        </p><p>
        Approximation and <a href="simulation.html">simulation</a> provide two means for 
        finding "good enough" solutions to numeric problems. For example, it is impossible 
        to compute an exact value of &pi;, the ratio of a circle's circumference to its
        diameter, because &pi;'s decimal representation contains infinitely many digits.
        Still, one can approximate &pi; by generating as many of these digits as desired.
        For another example, it may be hard to compute the launch velocity for a satellite
        and expensive to determine it by experimentation, but the effects of different
        launch velocities can be determined by simulation.
