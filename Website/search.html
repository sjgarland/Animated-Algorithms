    <p>
    When a problem cannot be solved by an explicit computation, it can often be solved by
    a search: finding a telephone number involves searching through a list of names; 
    finding the prime factors of an integer involves searching for divisors; finding the exit
    from a maze involves searching for a path to the exit.
    </p><p>
    Searches may employ brute force (for example, beginning with the first name in a list and
    proceeding serially).  Or they may capitalize on the organization of the list to search 
    in a less time-consuming fashion (for example, by starting at a name's approximate location
    in a list and proceeding from there).
    When all else fails, a search may resort to trial and error; even then, it's best to search 
    intelligently rather than haphazardly, as when trying to find a path out of a maze, and 
    to backtrack and try again when a search fails.
    </p><p>
    The goal of a simple search is to determine whether an item <em>x</em> occurs in a list 
    <em>a[1], ..., a[n]</em> of items.  If <em>x</em> is in the list, it may be useful to 
    identify where by producing an index <em>i</em> such that <em>x = a[i]</em>; 
    this index <em>i</em> indicates, for example, which element <em>a[i]</em> in a list of names
    must be modified to correct a misspelling or which element <em>b[i]</em> in another list
    <em>b[1], ..., b[n]</em> contains the telephone number of <em>a[i]</em>.
    </p><p>
    More generally, the goal of a search is to determine whether a list contains an item
    with a particular property (for example, whether a list of words contains one beginning
    with the letter <em>X</em>) and, if it does, to identify where the item can be found.
    </p>

    <h2>Search algorithms</h2>

    <p>
    The first two search algorithms look for items in simple lists.  One is suited
    to lists whose elements occur in no particular order (for example, a shuffled deck of cards),
    the other to lists arranged in some specific order (for example, an alphabetized list of names).
    The other algorithms conduct searches when information is not so neatly arranged in a list.
