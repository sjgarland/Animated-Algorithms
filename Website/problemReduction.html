An alternative to searching for a solution to a problem consists of breaking a problem down into a number of simpler subproblems, solving each of these subproblems, and using them to assemble a solution to the original problem. Algorithms that reduce
a problem's solution to the solution of simpler subproblems are often said to proceed by "divide and conquer".
