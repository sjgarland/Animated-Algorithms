    Exact answers to questions are the most satisfying, provided we
    can get them.  But often exact answers are impossible or
    extremely difficult to obtain, and we may be willing to settle
    for approximate answers instead.  The fact that we cannot write
    down exact decimal representations for irrational numbers such
    as $pi$ causes us little difficulty: for most purposes it is
    enough to know that $pi$ is approximately 3.14159265.  And to
    win a prize for counting the number of jelly beans in a large
    jar, we need only estimate that number more accurately than our
    competitors.
    </p><p>
    Approximation, then, helps us obtain answers that are good
    enough for the need at hand.  To illustrate the general nature
    of approximations, we develop several algorithms
    for approximating zeroes of functions.  Exercises suggest some
    algorithms for approximating other interesting values.
    </p>

    <h2>Zeroes of functions</h2>

    <p>
    Many problems can be solved by finding a zero of a function
    <em>f</e,â‰ˆ>, that is, by finding a value <em>x</em> such that
    <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)\|\|=\|\|0.  In Chapter 4, we found the
    effective interest rate for a loan by finding a zero of a
    function <em>f</em> such that <em>f</em>(<em>r</em>) is the final balance
    of the loan when the interest rate is <em>r</em>.  For another
    example, to find the square root of 2, we can define a function
    <em>f</em> by letting <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)\ = $x sup 2 ~-~ 2$ and then
    find a zero of <em>f</em>.
    </p><p>
    More generally, we can reduce the problem of computing the
    inverse of a one-to-one function to the problem of computing
    zeroes of related functions.  If <em>g</em> is a one-to-one
    function (i.e., if <em>g</em>(<em>x</em>)\|\|=\|\|<em>g</em>(<em>y</em>)
    implies <em>x</em>\|\|=\|\|<em>y</em>), then the <em>inverse</em> of
    <em>g</em> is that function $g sup -1$ such that
    
    .BS
    $g sup -1$(<em>y</em>) = <em>x</em>   if and only if   <em>g</em>(<em>x</em>)\|\|=\|\|<em>y</em>
    .BE
    (notice that <em>g</em> must be one-to-one for $g sup -1$ to be a
    function).  Now computing $g sup -1$(<em>y</em>) is equivalent to
    finding a zero of the function $g sub y$, where $g sub y (x)$\ =
    $g(x) ~-~ y$.  Since the square root function is the inverse of
    the square function, computing square roots is just a special
    case of computing inverses of functions.
    </p><p>
    For yet another example, students who have studied calculus can
    reduce the problem of finding the maximum or minimum value of a
    function to the problem of finding the zeroes of the derivative
    of that function.  Thus one technique, namely finding the zeroes
    of functions, helps solve many seemingly disparate problems.

    <h2>Exercises</h2>
    
   <ol>
    <li>
    Write a program to approximate a zero of a function by trisection.
    Compare the execution time of this algorithm with that of the bisection 
    algorithm when approximating zeroes of the functions <em>x<sup>2</sup>-2</em>
    and <em>sin(x)</em>.
    </li><li>
    Write a program to approximate a zero of a function by the
    method of false position.  Compare the execution time of this
    algorithm with that of the bisection algorithm when
    approximating zeroes of the functions <em>x<sup>2</sup>-2</em>
    and <em>sin(x)</em>.
    </li><li>
    One way to approximate the square root of a real number <em>r</em>
    is to start with an initial approximation <em>r<sub>0</sub></em> equal to
    <em>r/2</em> and then to produce a sequence of better
    approximations by letting <em>r<sub>n+1</sub></em> be
    $1 over 2 ( r sub n ^+^ r over { r sub n } )$.
    <ul>
        <li>
    Compare the efficiency of this algorithm with those that
    approximate zeroes of the function $x sup 2 ~-~ r$ using the
    procedures in <em>bisect</em>, <em>secant</em>, and <em>newton</em>.
    </li><li>
    Show that this algorithm produces the same sequence of
    approximations as does Newton's method.
    </li>
    </ul>
    <li>
    Newton's method is very powerful if used with care, but it has
    its pitfalls.  To illustrate these difficulties consider the
    function
    .BS
    $f(x) ~=~ x sup 3 ^-^ 5x ^+^ 3$
    .BE
    Use Newton's method to approximate zeroes of this function
    starting with the following initial approximations, counting the
    number of iterations required for the method to converge.
    .BS
    -2,  0,  1.2,  1.25,  1.3,  1.4,  2
    .BE
    Since <em>f</em> is a cubic, you will not be surprised to notice
    that it has three separate zeroes.  However you will notice that
    initial approximations which are very close together can lead to
    different zeroes in an apparently haphazard manner, and the
    number of iterations needed to find a given zero varies
    considerably.
    </li><li>
    Show that Newton's method diverges when used to approximate a
    zero of the function $f(x) ~=~ e sup -x ln(x)$.
    .EX 6.  
    Find a function <em>f</em> and an initial approximation to a zero
    of <em>f</em> such that Newton's method oscillates when used to
    approximation a zero of <em>f</em> starting with that
    approximation.
    .EX 7.
    Write a program to input the coefficients <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>,
    <em>c</em>, <em>d</em> of a cubic polynomial $p(x) ~=~ ax sup 3 ^+^ bx
    sup 2 ^+^ cx ^+^ d$ and to determine, within an accuracy of $10
    sup -6$ and without any further input, all zeroes of $p$.
    Use one of the following methods when $a ~!=~ 0$.
    .EP (a)
    First locate one real zero <em>z</em> of <em>p</em> (which must exist
    since any polynomial of odd degree has at least one real zero).
    Then find a quadratic polynomial <em>q</em> such that $p(x) ~=~
    (x^-^z)q(x)$ by synthetic division.  The remaining zeroes of
    <em>p</em> are the zeroes of <em>q</em>.
    .EP (b)
    Alternatively, find the relative maxima, minima, and points of
    inflection of <em>p</em> by finding the zeroes of its derivative.
    Use this information to determine the number and location of the
    zeroes of <em>p</em>.
    .EX 8.
    Is the bisection method or Newton's method more appropriate for
    use in the program you wrote for Exercise 7?  Why?
    .EX 9.
    Generalize your program for Exercise 7(b) to input the
    coefficients of an arbitrary polynomial and then determine the
    number and location of all zeroes of that polynomial.  (Hint:
    use recursion to reduce the problem of finding the zeroes of a
    polynomial of degree <em>n</em> to the problem of finding the
    zeroes of the derivative of that polynomial, which itself is a
    polynomial of degree <em>n</em>\^\(mi\^1).
    .EX 10.
    Devise an algorithm for approximating the maximum value of a
    function on an interval.
    .EX 11.
    Computers can approximate the values of mathematical functions
    such as <em>exp</em> and <em>sin</em> using infinite series.
    Investigate how many terms in each of the following series must
    be summed to produce approximations that are within $10 sup -6$
    of the correct value when 0\|\|\(<=\|\|<em>x</em>\|\|\(<=\|\|1.
    .EP (a)
    $sin (x) ~~=~~ x ~-~ { x sup 3 } over 3! ~+~ { x sup 5 } over 5!
    ~-~ { x sup 7 } over 7! ~+~ ...$
    .EP (b)
    $exp (x) ~~=~~ 1 ~+~ x ~+~ { x sup 2 } over 2! ~+~ { x sup 3 }
    over 3! ~+~ { x sup 4 } over 4! ~+~ ...$
    .EX 12.
    To approximate the area under a curve, we can divide that area
    up into a number of strips, approximate the area of each strip,
    and add the approximations together.  \*(FR illustrates three
    methods for performing such an approximation.
