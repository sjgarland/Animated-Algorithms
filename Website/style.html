<h1>Programming style</h1>

<p>
The few programs we have written so far are short and simple.
Nonetheless it is instructive to examine them further before
going on to write longer and more complicated ones.  Much good
advice about programming can be distilled from these
examples&mdash;advice that will help keep more ambitious undertakings as
short and simple as possible.
</p><p>
The single most important measure of the quality of a computer
program is whether or not it works.  A program may be a work of
art, embody the most modern techniques, and consume practically
no resources at all; but if it doesn't work, it is of little
use.  Hence it would seen that other considerations such as
structure, style, simplicity, or even neatness, are of lesser
importance.  Yet experience has shown just the opposite: these
considerations must be taken into account to produce working,
high-quality programs.  Some of the reasons for this are as
follows.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Almost all programs contain errors initially.  Well-written
programs excel in two ways.  They are less likely to contain
errors in the first place, and those errors they do contain are
easier to locate and correct than errors hidden in
poorly-written programs.
</li><li>>
For a program to be used with confidence, not only must it work,
but potential users must be convinced that it works.  While
evidence of a program having worked in the past is sometimes
convincing, it does not guarantee that the program will work in
untried circumstances.  Nothing builds confidence like a
well-organized, coherent, and easy-to-understand program.
</li><li>>
Programs are rarely used only once.  Future users of a program
(including the original programmer) must be able to read the
program in order to understand what it is supposed to do and how
it does it.
</li><li>>
Few programs are never changed.  It is far easier and safer to
modify a well-written program than a poorly-written one.
</li><li>>
A well-written program reflects a well-conceived design; such a
program is almost always simpler and more efficient than a
hastily-written or jumbled one.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For these reasons, the task of writing a computer program should
be taken as seriously as the task of writing English prose.
Programs and prose are both means of communication.  Authors
must think first about what they wish to communicate; then they
must think about how to organize and express ideas clearly and
logically.  Good programs, like good prose, should be a pleasure
to read.
</p><p>
As with matters of English style, style in programming is
subjective.  Nonetheless, there are rules you can follow that
almost always lead to better style and that are a good
foundation for developing your own personal style.  Following
are some of these rules.
</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>

<p>
Comment your program well.
Use one or more lines of comments to introduce your program.
The programs in this book all begin with short descriptions of
what they do.  Comments at the beginning of your programs should
also include such other information as your name, the date on
which you wrote the program, the date and reasons for any
modifications you made to the program, directions for using the
program, etc.  These are all things you or someone else may wish
to know when reading the program.  Don't trust them to memory!
</p><p>
Comment your program as you go.  If you change your program,
change your comments too.  Nothing destroys comprehensibility so
much as inaccurate comments or comments that were never written.
Try writing your comments first; then write your program to do
what the comments say.
</p><p>
Express your comments in concise, coherent English.  Spell
properly and correct typing mistakes.  Don't think that typing
mistakes inside comments are unimportant and can be ignored or
corrected later.  All too often, later turns out to be never,
and misspelled comments unnecessarily decrease the patience of a
reader trying to understand the program.
</p><p>
Don't overcomment.  A few well-chosen comments convey more
information than a rambling dissertation.  Consider what your
reader needs to know, not just what you want to say
</p>

<h2>Displaying programs</h2>

<p>
Display your program in a fashion that reflects its structure
and makes that structure pleasing to the eye.  Indent variable
declarations, the bodies of programs, and other structures in a
consistent fashion such as the one used in this book.  Use a
utility program, sometimes known as a <em>pretty printer</em>,
</p><p>
that indents your programs automatically if you have one
available.  Indentation makes it easier for a reader to
discern the structure of your program and to focus attention on a
particular section of that structure.
</p><p>
In longer programs, use blank lines to separate sections of
the program and to avoid straining the reader's eyes.
</p><p>
Use adequate blank space within program lines and use it
consistently.  Use spaces around keywords, around the assignment
operator, and in long expressions.  Use a blank space at the
beginning and end of each comment.
Choose a convention that improves readability and stick to it.
</p>

<h2>Coding style</h2>

<p>
Keep lines in your program a reasonable length.  Break up an
expression or a line that is too complicated&mdash;if it's too
long to write compactly, it's also too long to be understood in
a glance.
</p><p>
Choose meaningful, but succinct, names for your variables and
other identifiers.  If you use a variable for an obvious purpose
in several adjoining statements, then give it a single-character
name; if you use it to communicate information among distant
parts of a program, give it a longer name that describes its
use.
</p><p>
Assign names to constants that may change when you modify the
program.  Use these symbolic constants instead of the constants
themselves in program statements.
</p><p>
Adhering to these rules will serve us well as we begin to write
programs.  Further rules aimed at enhancing programming
style occur in Sections 3.6 and 4.7.
