# Animations for _Animated Algorithms_

Animations will be constructed initially with Ziro Studio.  Later animations may be constructed 
with Scratch, p5js, and other Python libraries (pygame, turtle graphics, Pythonista).  How should 
we enable users to see non-JavaScript animations that will run on their machine?

What code do we show for the algorithms?  Just unanimated code in Python (or JavaScript)?  
Or code enchanced by animations in Ziro (or p5js)?  People will be able to see this code in 
Ziro Studio.  Should we explain how it works?

Some animations will use the physics engine in Ziro Studio.  Many will not.  See these [tips](ziro.md#Tips).

## Using Ziro

What guidelines can be given for setting the camera's position?

What works best for animations that are essentially two-dimensional?  How do we minimize distortions 
due to perspective and parallax?

What sizes work best for objects in an animation?  For example, how many balls can we show with 
observable differences in their sizes?
