# Languages for _Animated Algorithms_

Algorithms will be implemented initially in Python.

Later they may also be implemented in JavaScript so that readers can see animations without having to leave the _Animated Algorithms_ website.

It may help to implement some algorithms and animations in Scratch to make them more accessible to younger readers.

If the site will eventually support multiple languages, it will be necessary to minimize language-specific details in the descriptions of the algorithms.  Code for the algorithms can be shown in a tabbed display, with one tab for each language.
